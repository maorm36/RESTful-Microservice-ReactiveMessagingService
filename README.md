# RESTful-Microservice-Reactive-Service

ReactiveMessagingService is a **standalone reactive microservice** for managing messages addressed to **specific users**, identified by their **email address**.

---

## Service Purpose

This microservice stores and retrieves messages that are targeted to specific recipients (`target`) and sent by specific senders (`sender`).  
All endpoints are implemented **reactively** (i.e., return `Mono` / `Flux` in a typical reactive stack).

---

## Message Model — `MessageBoundary`

A message is represented by the following JSON structure:

- **id** (String)  
  A unique message identifier generated by the service when a new message is created.  
  **Cannot be changed** once stored.

- **target** (String)  
  Recipient email address (the user the message is sent to).

- **sender** (String)  
  Sender email address. Must be a **valid email** format. Provided by the client.

- **title** (String)  
  Message title. Must **not** be empty. Provided by the client.

- **publicationTimestamp** (String / ISO-8601 timestamp)  
  Timestamp generated by the service when a message is created (date + time).  
  Must be set by the service in the Boundary in a manner similar to what was defined in class.

- **urgent** (Boolean)  
  Indicates whether the message is urgent. Provided by the client.

- **moreDetails** (Object / JSON)  
  Flexible JSON structure containing additional details. The content is set by the service operators (client).  
  Can be an empty JSON object (`{}`).
